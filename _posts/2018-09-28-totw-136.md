*"Sometimes, when the material is really good, you put expectations on yourself
to make it the best possible show. You're not just serving up the regular hash
and doing your job and going home."* â€” Peter Dinklage

# Introducing `absl::*_hash_map`

There is a new family of associative containers in town. They boast improvements
to efficiency and provide early access to APIs from C++17. They also provide
developers with direct control over their implementation and default hash 
functions, which is important for the long term evolution of a code base. New
code should prefer these types over `std::unordered_map`. All of the maps and 
sets in this family have APIs that are nearly identical to 
`std::unordered_map`, so transitioning to them is easy.

For every `absl::*_hash_map` there is also an `absl::*_hash_set`; however, the
diagrams will only depict the `map` case and we will often refer to just the
`map`.

## `absl::flat_hash_map` and `absl::flat_hash_set`

These should be your default choice. They store their `value_type` inside the
main array. Because they move data when they rehash, elements don't get pointer 
stability. If you need pointer stability or your values are large, consider 
using `absl::node_hash_map` instead, or `absl::flat_hash_map<Key,
std::unique_ptr<Value>>`, possibly.

## `absl::node_hash_map` and `absl::node_hash_set`

These allocate their `value_type` in nodes outside of the main array (like
`std::unordered_map`). Because of the separate allocation, they provide pointer
stability (the address of objects stored in the map does not change) for the
stored data and empty slots only require 8 bytes. Additionally, they can store
things that are neither moveable nor copyable.

An alternative to `node_hash_map<K, V>` is
`flat_hash_map<K, std::unique_ptr<V>>`, and similarly for `node_hash_set`.
