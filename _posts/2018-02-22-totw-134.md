So, you read [Tip 126](/tips/126) and are ready to leave `new` behind.
Everything's going fine until you try to use `absl::make_unique()` or
`std::make_unique()` (C++14) to construct an object with a private
constructor, and it fails to compile. Let's take a look at a concrete
example of this problem to understand what went wrong. Then, we can
discuss some solutions.

## Example: Manufacturing Widgets

You're defining a class to represent widgets. Each widget has an identifier and
those identifiers are subject to certain constraints. To ensure those
constraints are always met, you declare the constructor of the `Widget` class
private and provide users with a factory function, `Make()`, for generating
widgets with proper identifiers. (See [TotW #42](/tips/42) for advice on why
factory functions are preferable to initializer methods.)

```c++
// Bad code
class Widget {
 public:
  static std::unique_ptr<Widget> Make() {
    return absl::make_unique<Widget>(GenerateId());
  }

 private:
  Widget(int id) : id_(id) {}
  static int GenerateId();

  int id_;
}
```

When you try to compile, you get an error like this:

```
error: calling a private constructor of class 'Widget'
    { return unique_ptr<_Tp>(new _Tp(std::forward<_Args>(__args)...)); }
                                 ^
note: in instantiation of function template specialization
'absl::make_unique<Widget, int>' requested here
    return absl::make_unique<Widget>(GenerateId());
                ^
note: declared private here
  Widget(int id) : id_(id) {}
  ^
```

While `Make()` has access to the private constructor, `absl::make_unique()`
does not! Note that this issue can also arise with friends. For example, a
friend of `Widget` would have the same problem using `absl::make_unique()`
to construct a `Widget`.

## Recommendations

We recommend either of these alternatives:

* Use `new` and `WrapUnique()`, but explain your choice. For example,

```c++
    // Using `new` to access a non-public constructor.
    return absl::WrapUnique(new Widget(...));
```

* Consider whether the constructor may be safely exposed publicly. If so, make
  it public and document when direct construction is appropriate.

In many cases, marking a constructor private is over-engineering. In those
cases, the best solution is to mark your constructors public and document their
proper use. However, if your constructor needs to be private (say, to ensure
class invariants), then use `new` and `WrapUnique`.

## Why can't I just friend `absl::make_unique()`?

You might be tempted to friend `absl::make_unique()`, which would give it access
to your private constructors. *This is a bad idea*, for a few reasons.

First, while a full discussion of friending practices is beyond the scope of
this tip, a good rule of thumb is "no long-distance friendships". Otherwise,
you're creating a competing declaration of the friend, one not maintained by the
owner. See also the
[style guide's advice](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Friends).

Second, notice that you are depending on an implementation detail of
`absl::make_unique()`, namely that it directly calls `new`. If it is refactored
so that it indirectly calls `new` -- for example, if it is changed to call
`std::make_unique()` once you are ready for C++14 -- then the friend
declaration will become useless.

Finally, by friending `absl::make_unique()`, you've allowed *anyone* to create
your objects that way, so why not just declare your constructors public and
avoid the problem altogether?

## What about `std::shared_ptr`?

The situation is somewhat different in the case of `std:shared_ptr`. There is no
`absl::WrapShared()` and the analog -- `std::shared_ptr<T>(new T(...))` --
involves two allocations, where `std::make_shared()` can be done with one. If
this difference is important, then consider the *passkey idiom*: have the
constructor take a special token that only certain code can create.

For example,

```c++
class Widget {
  class Token {
   private:
    Token() {}
    friend Widget;
  };

 public:
  static std::shared_ptr<Widget> Make() {
    return std::make_shared<Widget>(Token{}, GenerateId());
  }

  Widget(Token, int id) : id_(id) {}

 private:
  static int GenerateId();

  int id_;
};
```
