# About Abseil

Abseil is an open source collection of C++ libraries drawn from the most
fundamental pieces of Google’s internal codebase. These libraries are the
nuts-and-bolts that underpin almost everything Google runs. Bits and pieces of
these APIs are embedded in most of our open source projects, and Abseil aims to
bring them together into one comprehensive project. Abseil encompasses the most
basic building blocks of Google’s codebase: code that is production-tested and
will be fully maintained for years to come.

Our primary purpose in releasing Abseil is to more easily support Google open
source projects sharing their C++ code outside of Google. In some cases, Abseil
provides pieces missing from the C++ standard; in others, Abseil provides
alternatives to the standard for particular use cases we've needed in the Google
codebase. We denote those cases clearly within the library code we provide you.

Abseil is not meant to be competitor to any standard library code; we've just
found that many of these utilities serve a purpose within our codebase, and we
now want to provide those resources to the C++ community as a whole.
